## Why the F did I use github for my blog?

When thinking from the perspectives of power and environmental impact, Github doesn't seem to be a responsible tool to use as blogging platform. Yes, it is true that Github is owned by Microsoft(2018). Yes, github has over 2500 employees. Yes, Github has a huge revenue of over 200 million dolars.

But, Github is also the first place to visit when you are looking for open-source projects. This is the place where you can share, collaborate and dig through the code of other developers and artists. You could describe it as the social network for programmers.

Github is free when you publicly share your source code (kind of the point of open-source projects).
For private repositories and better costumization, they charge a subscribtion fee.
