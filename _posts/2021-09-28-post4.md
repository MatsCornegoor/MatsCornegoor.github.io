## A shared collection of future events

As Meeuwis and I both wanted to expand our frame of artistic references we decided to create a shared calendar for upcomming events related to the digital craft minor. The public link of the calendar can be found [here](http://server.matscornegoor.nl/index.php/apps/calendar/p/gsmA4KpNybnCkxNr/dayGridMonth/now) and the subscribtion link can be found [here](webcal://server.matscornegoor.nl/remote.php/dav/public-calendars/gsmA4KpNybnCkxNr/?export).
