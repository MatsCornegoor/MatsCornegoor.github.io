## Learning goals

![](/img/goals.jpg)

Goal 1
I want to get better at writing artist statements and learn to articulate my artistic political perspective towards the topics that I'm researching. In order to get better at this, my creative vocabulary has to grow. The best way to do this is to have regulary discussions with others and and ask for their opinion. This is something that I normaly don't do, but surely would be really helpfull. So, from now on I am going to discuss my work / current interests with (creative)people on a weekly basis.

Goal 2
It often happens to me that I make some (DIY) prototypes and do a few experiments, but then don't know how to develop it into an actual artwork. These projects end up somewhere in the corner of my room and never see any daylight again. This is a waste because these projects could have the potential to become something awesome. A solution for this problem would be to find a better way to organize critical reflection. Not every experiment has to become a finished project, but good critical reflection could give useful insights. Because this goal is closely related to goal 1, I will test reflection methods on a weekly basis.

Goal 3 
As I spend 50% of my time on the internet, a lot information and inspiration that I am consuming is derived from within my own filterbuble. For this reason I want to spend more time offline! So my goal is to visit/observe as many interesting events, musea, places and objects in the neighborhood of Rotterdam and document them in my online archive of ofline things.
