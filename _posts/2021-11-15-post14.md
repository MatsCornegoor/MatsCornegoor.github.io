## Pakket monitoring using Esp8266 and Little Snitch

To transport data through internet, our computer splits it up into network packets. These packets use a special structure containing information such as its source and destination address. Network monitoring applications like Little Snitch can be used to log all the in/outgoing packets on your computer. After spending some time with Little Snitch, I really like that it shows my constant demand for data(something that I normally don't realise). A few of the connections are made with servers on the other side of the world showing the scale and complexity of the network.My goal is to allow people to have a similar experience, but without the barrier of having to install a special application. In order to do this, I took a deep dive into internet protocols and pakket monitoring. After some experimentation I managed to use a Esp8266 chip to act as a pakket sensor that can filter out all 2,4GHZ data packets floating through the air within a specific range. As a next step I would like to find ways to visualise this data.
