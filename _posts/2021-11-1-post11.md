Currently the total market value of public Cloud Computing services is estimated to be 312 Billon Dolar. It is expected to double in size within the next few years(1). The scale of Cloud Computing infrastructure is a clear sign of societies growing dependancy on data. 
In many cases, companies have such a large amount of data in the online that it would take years to transfer the data over regular internet infrastructure. This is why the dominating Cloud Computing providers have special data transport devices (basically giant USB sticks).
