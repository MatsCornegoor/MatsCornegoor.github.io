## Fan matrix experiment

This is an experiment where I used 30 computer fans to create a matrix display. The goal of this experiment was to use the display to visualise the constant flow of data that is being captured with my pakket monitor tool. The computer fans are chosen because they are a necessary part for Cloud Computing infrastructure. Sadly, the fans did not create the effect I was looking for, so I will look for different visualisation methods.
