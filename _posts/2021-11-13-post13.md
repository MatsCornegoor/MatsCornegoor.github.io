## Amazon Web Services dependancy experiment

According to information that I found online, Amazon Web Services owns roughly 30 percent of all Cloud Computing infrastructure. This made me curious to find out if could find some websites that depend on Amazon to stay online. As an experiment, I used IP tables to block all of their servers. The following images are screenshots from the websites I tried to visit.
