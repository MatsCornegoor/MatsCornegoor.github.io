## What kind of role could NFT’s play in the future of digital art?

In the first quarter of this year something unexpected happend in the art scene. The interest in NFT (non-fungible token) art suddenly took a massive leap. Artworks were getting sold for insane amounts of money and new marketplaces started popping up. Why where people willing to pay such large amount of money for (in my opinion ugly) art that in many cases consisted out of memes and collages. As if the main force behind this shift was hype instead of appreciation of the works itself. 

The media attention around this crypto art also whipped up the discussion about the environmental impact of minting on Ethereum which is currently the main blockchain used for NFT’s. While this is just a technical obstacle and blockchains can already be relatively eco-friendly, it is still something worth to consider when entering this world.  

My interests in NFT’s is mainly driven by the surrounding culture and the idea that a work can be freely accessible for everyone but hold a certain value at the same time.
