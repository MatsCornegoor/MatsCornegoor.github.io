## Diving into the world of Telnet

During my research into "De Digitale Stad" and the origin of the internet, I stumbled upon the "Telnet" protocol.
This was one of the first interfaces that could be used to share messages and other filed through a community network.
Out of curiosity I decided to install this "old" protocol and try it on my computer. I was amazed when I found out that one of the game servers (FIBS) was still online and even more suprised when I discoverd that people where still playing this game. Together with Meeuwis I tried to play it!
