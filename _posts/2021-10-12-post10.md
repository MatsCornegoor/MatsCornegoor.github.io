## Communication devices

During the arduino workshop, Meeuwis and I build a communication tool that we could use to send messages on a radio network.
The interesting thing about this tool is that it could be used as a way to excape the centraliised networks where big "tech" companies have controll over your data. The DIY bottum up aproach and the topic of decentralisation are things that I find interesting at the moment.
