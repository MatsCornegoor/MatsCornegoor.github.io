## Looking back at the workshop of Radboud Mens

During this workshop we experimented with fans and air. Our goal was to create a visual and acoustic representation of air pollution.
We thought of pollution as the inbalance between the elements (Nitrogen · Oxygen · Argon · Carbon Dioxide) and decided to connect this with sound.
Using an API we could extract the air data of various locations and use this to turn certain fans on/off. The installation could be seen as a tool to compare the airquality of places around the world. The thing that I liked most about this experiment is that we made an invisable process more aproachable. The physicallity of our installation made it easier to connect with the topic.
